Taxi Fare Prediction App
This project is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts taxi fares based on trip details. The model uses factors such as trip distance, duration, time of day, traffic conditions, and weather to estimate the fare.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to provide real-time taxi fare estimation based on user input. The app uses a pre-trained machine learning model (Taxi.pkl) to make predictions.

Features:
- Predicts taxi fares based on trip details
- User-friendly web interface built with Streamlit
- Supports categorical inputs like traffic conditions, weather, time of day
- Uses pickled ML model for inference
